    Heap vs. Stack
        Heap variables extend beyond specific functions

    Objects
        Implementation
            Objects are just structs

        properties and access modifiers
        
        Constructors/Deconstructors
            If you define something in the heap in the constructor, you must
            "delete 

            Deconstructors
                Run automatically at the end of the "main" program

        Copy constructor
            creates an object that has the same data but stored at unique memory
            location. 
            
            for ex. Employee c2 = Employee(c1);

    Data management: heap vs. stack vs. global variable

        Destroying data:
            delete varName; varName = null;

        Java vs C++
            Java has a garbage collector -> so you don't need to delete
            variables defined in the heap
